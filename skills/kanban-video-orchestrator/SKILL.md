# kanban-video-orchestrator

## Purpose

Plan, set up, and monitor a multi-agent video production pipeline backed by agent runtime Kanban. Use when the user wants to make ANY video — narrative film, product/marketing, music video, explainer, ASCII/terminal art, abstract/generative loop, comic, 3D, real-time/installation — and the work warrants decomposition into specialized profiles (writer, designer, animator, renderer, voice, editor, etc.) coordinated through a kanban board. Performs adaptive discovery to scope the brief, designs an appropriate team for the requested style, generates the setup script that creates agent runtime profiles + initial kanban task, then helps monitor execution and intervene when tasks stall or fail. Routes scenes to whichever agent runtime rendering / audio / design skill fits each beat (`ascii-video`, `manim-video`, `p5js`, `comfyui`, `touchdesigner-mcp`, `blender-mcp`, `pixel-art`, `baoyu-comic`, `claude-design`, `excalidraw`, `songsee`, `heartmula`, …) plus external APIs for TTS, image-gen, and image-to-video as needed.

## Use When

- The user request matches `kanban-video-orchestrator`, `kanban video orchestrator`, `creative` or the skill description.
- Plan, set up, and monitor a multi-agent video production pipeline backed by agent runtime Kanban. Use when the user wants to make ANY video — narrative film, product/marketing, music video, explainer, ASCII/terminal art, abstract/generative loop, comic, 3D, real-time/installation — and the work warrants decomposition into specialized profiles (writer, designer, animator, renderer, voice, editor, etc.) coordinated through a kanban board. Performs adaptive discovery to scope the brief, designs an appropriate team for the requested style, generates the setup script that creates agent runtime profiles + initial kanban task, then helps monitor execution and intervene when tasks stall or fail. Routes scenes to whichever agent runtime rendering / audio / design skill fits each beat (`ascii-video`, `manim-video`, `p5js`, `comfyui`, `touchdesigner-mcp`, `blender-mcp`, `pixel-art`, `baoyu-comic`, `claude-design`, `excalidraw`, `songsee`, `heartmula`, …) plus external APIs for TTS, image-gen, and image-to-video as needed.
- The task benefits from domain-specific workflow, checks, output structure, or safe fallback behavior.

## Workflow

1. Clarify target artifact, audience, style, platform, dimensions, and source material.
2. Create a production-ready brief, prompt, storyboard, or asset plan before tool execution.
3. Use image/video/design tools only when available in the current session.
4. If tools are unavailable, return portable prompts/specs and state NOT RUN.

## Codex Runtime Rules

- Use only tools, plugins, MCP servers, files, commands, and credentials that are actually available in the current Codex session.
- If an external write, install, publish, deploy, paid action, credential use, account operation, physical-device action, or production action is needed, ask for explicit confirmation first.
- If the required tool is unavailable, return a portable fallback such as Markdown, CSV, prompt pack, implementation plan, config sketch, or verification checklist.
- Do not claim files, media, issues, API calls, payments, deployments, transactions, messages, or integrations were created unless there is concrete local or tool evidence.
- Treat source repository runtime details as historical source context, not active Codex capabilities.

## Avoid

- Do not claim media was generated unless a real artifact exists.
- Do not bypass copyright, likeness, or safety constraints.

## Output

Return the useful artifact first, then evidence and verification status.

For non-trivial work, include:

```markdown
Result: ...
Evidence: ...
Verification: PASS/FAIL/NOT RUN
