# inference-sh-cli

## Purpose

Run 150+ AI apps via inference.sh CLI (infsh) — image generation, video creation, LLMs, search, 3D, social automation. Uses the terminal tool. Triggers: inference.sh, infsh, ai apps, flux, veo, image generation, video generation, seedream, seedance, tavily

## Use When

- The user request matches `inference-sh-cli`, `inference sh cli`, `devops` or the skill description.
- Run 150+ AI apps via inference.sh CLI (infsh) — image generation, video creation, LLMs, search, 3D, social automation. Uses the terminal tool. Triggers: inference.sh, infsh, ai apps, flux, veo, image generation, video generation, seedream, seedance, tavily
- The task benefits from domain-specific workflow, checks, output structure, or safe fallback behavior.

## Workflow

1. Identify environment, repo, service, config, credentials, and desired state.
2. Prefer read-only status and dry-run commands before writes.
3. Require explicit confirmation for deploy, publish, delete, credential, production, or external writes.
4. Provide rollback, verification, and audit steps.

## Codex Runtime Rules

- Use only tools, plugins, MCP servers, files, commands, and credentials that are actually available in the current Codex session.
- If an external write, install, publish, deploy, paid action, credential use, account operation, physical-device action, or production action is needed, ask for explicit confirmation first.
- If the required tool is unavailable, return a portable fallback such as Markdown, CSV, prompt pack, implementation plan, config sketch, or verification checklist.
- Do not claim files, media, issues, API calls, payments, deployments, transactions, messages, or integrations were created unless there is concrete local or tool evidence.
- Treat source repository runtime details as historical source context, not active Codex capabilities.

## Avoid

- Do not mutate production, cloud resources, CI secrets, webhooks, or deployments without confirmation.
- Do not hide operational risk.

## Output

Return the useful artifact first, then evidence and verification status.
