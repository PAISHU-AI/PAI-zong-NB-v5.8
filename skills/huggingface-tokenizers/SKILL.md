# huggingface-tokenizers

## Purpose

Fast tokenizers optimized for research and production. Rust-based implementation tokenizes 1GB in <20 seconds. Supports BPE, WordPiece, and Unigram algorithms. Train custom vocabularies, track alignments, handle padding/truncation. Integrates seamlessly with transformers. Use when you need high-performance tokenization or custom tokenizer training.

## Use When

- The user request matches `huggingface-tokenizers`, `huggingface tokenizers`, `mlops` or the skill description.
- Fast tokenizers optimized for research and production. Rust-based implementation tokenizes 1GB in <20 seconds. Supports BPE, WordPiece, and Unigram algorithms. Train custom vocabularies, track alignments, handle padding/truncation. Integrates seamlessly with transformers. Use when you need high-performance tokenization or custom tokenizer training.
- The task benefits from domain-specific workflow, checks, output structure, or safe fallback behavior.

## Workflow

1. Identify model/task, dataset, environment, compute, dependencies, and expected artifact.
2. Prefer local inspection and minimal reproducible commands before expensive training or cloud use.
3. Require confirmation for GPU spend, cloud resources, downloads, uploads, or long-running jobs.
4. Report metrics, checkpoints, configs, and limitations clearly.

## Codex Runtime Rules

- Use only tools, plugins, MCP servers, files, commands, and credentials that are actually available in the current Codex session.
- If an external write, install, publish, deploy, paid action, credential use, account operation, physical-device action, or production action is needed, ask for explicit confirmation first.
- If the required tool is unavailable, return a portable fallback such as Markdown, CSV, prompt pack, implementation plan, config sketch, or verification checklist.
- Do not claim files, media, issues, API calls, payments, deployments, transactions, messages, or integrations were created unless there is concrete local or tool evidence.
- Treat source repository runtime details as historical source context, not active Codex capabilities.

## Avoid

- Do not start paid compute, large downloads, training jobs, or data uploads without confirmation.
- Do not claim model quality without evaluation evidence.

## Output

Return the useful artifact first, then evidence and verification status.
